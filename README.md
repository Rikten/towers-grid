#About
Originally completed in mid-2014, this is an algorithm to generate valid layouts for the [Towers](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/puzzles/js/towers.html) game from Simon Tatham's puzzle collection (which I had been playing a lot at the time).

##Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/luctalatinian/towers-grid.git
cd towers-grid
make
./a.out <grid size>
```

##Interactivity (or lack thereof)
The purpose of this project was primarily to devise an algorithm for generating layouts for the game, and as such, there is currently no way to play the game with the generated grid. Were I to come back to this project, the addition of this would ideally be the next step.
